## Description
Area Defending System (ADS) is a simple, stable and powerfull script that allows mission makers to generate a cycle of random infantry attacks 
on area positioned on map from editor.
You can specify the number of attacks and the time between each one.
It is sufficient to define two concentric areas from editor. The enemies will be created between the two areas in such way that the internal 
one is free from enemies and used as defending zone from attacks.
Enemy spawning position is random. They will attack the center of the internal area, with a range of 25m, following random directional waypoints.
You can start, stop and restart the cycle at will. You can also start two at the same time.
It works both in SP and MP.

All feedback is appreciated!
